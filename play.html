    <h4>The Drawing-room at Hunstanton Chase</h4>

        <h6 class="Mrs.ALLONBY name">Allonby</h6> <p class="Allonby speech">What a comfort it is to have got rid of the men for a little!</p>

        <h6 class="LADY STUTFIELD name">lady stufield</h6> <p class="lady speech">Yes; men persecute us dreadfully, don’t they?</p>

        <h6 class="MRS. ALLONBY name">Allonby</h6> <p class="Allonby speech">Pesecute us?  I wish they did.</p>

        <h6 class="LADY HUNSTANTON name">lady Hunstanton</h6> <p class="lady speech">my dear!</p>

        <h6 class="MRS. ALLONBY name">Allonby</h6> <p class="Allonby speech">The annoying thing is that the wretches can be perfect happy without us.  That is why I think it is every woman’s duty never to leave them alone for a single moment, except during this short breathin space after dinner; without which I believe we poor women would be absolutely worn to shadows</p>

             <p class="stage-direction">[_Enter Servants with coffee_.]</p>

        <h6 class="LADY HUNSTANTON name">lady Hunstaton</h6> <p class="lady speech"> Worn to shadows, dear?</p>

        <h6 class="MRS. ALLONBY name">Allonby</h6> <p class=Allonby speech> Yes, Lady Hunstanton.  It is such a strain keeping men upto the mark.  They are always trying to escape from us.</p>

        <h6 class="LADY STUTFIELD name">lady stutfield</h6> <p class="lady speech">It seems to me that it is we who are always trying to escape from them.  Men are so very, very heartless.  They know their power and use it</p>
            <p class="stage-direction">[_Takes coffee from Servant_.]</p>
        <h6 class="LADY CAROLINE name">laddy Caroline</h6> <p class="lady speech"> What stuff and nonsense all this about men is!  The thing to do is to keep men in their properplace.</p>
